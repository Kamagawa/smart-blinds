powering arduino - options:
- barrel jack 7-12V regulated
- vin 7-12V regulated
- usb 5V unregulated

scenario 1 - ideal, assuming motor is strong enough:
- my current 7.5v adapter with 1A
- motor controller and motor get power from arduino vin
- parts to order: motor, motor bracket, screws

scenario 2 - 12V motor:
- will need a 12 V adapter with terminal block connector
- cannot use arduino jack and vin to transfer 12V power since too much current
  - will need relay board
- motor will get power from relay board, and motor controller from arduino
- parts to order: motor, motor bracket, screws, 12V adapter, relay board
